**T2DM-PaC Comorbidity Predictor**

An artificial intelligence model that predicts the likelihood of Type 2 diabetes mellitus-associated pancreatic cancer comorbidity using gene expression profiles.
This tool is part of the research: "A Machine Learning Prediction Model for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Associated Pancreatic Cancer"

**Overview**

Leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze gene expression data, this model helps identify potential pancreatic cancer development in T2DM patients, enabling earlier detection and intervention strategies.
