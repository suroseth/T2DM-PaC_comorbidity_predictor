Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder, which can lead to various associated comorbidities. Individuals with T2DM face a higher risk of cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer (PaC), which has a poor prognosis and high mortality rates. Given this elevated risk, there's a growing demand for early detection and effective screening. We utilized supervised machine learning to construct a model based on gene expression data from individuals with T2DM and pancreatic cancer to aid in comorbidity detection in T2DM individuals. A set of comorbidity genes features were designed using various bioinformatics analysis using literature text data and gene expression data from T2D-PaC condition [GSE74629, GSE15932]. We extracted all the known T2DM-PaC comorbidity genes reported in literature using pubmed.mineR. We extracted differentially expressed genes, genes acting as hub, and perturbed genes during pathway simulation using comorbidity gene expression data. Using these comorbidity gene features and gene expression from T2DM patient samples and PaC patient samples we created two machine learning models for T2DM and PaC respectively. Both these models were combined to create the T2DM-PaC comorbidity prediction model. And finally tested on T2DM-PaC comorbidity samples. Using literature text data from pubmed abstracts we identified 16 genes which were associated with T2DM-PaC comorbidity. From the T2DM-PaC gene expression dataset we identified 15 differentially expressed genes. There were 22 genes identified from WGCNA analysis which were acting as hubs. Pathway Simulation of KEGG pathways resulted in 15 perturbed genes. After removing redundancy, we obtained 67 genes which were labelled as T2DM-PaC comorbidity features. Model combination of T2DM ML model and PaC ML model, when tested upon T2DM-PaC comorbidity dataset gave an accuracy 90% and F1 score of 90%. This ML based prediction of T2D-PaC comorbidity can help in detection and screening of PaC in T2DM patients.
