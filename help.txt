1. Download all files from both folders.
2. Files description-
* normalization.R file is to normalize the preprocessed gene expression data. T2DM-PaC_prediction_model.py file is for making predictions.
* result_preprocessing_GSE74629_3.csv, result_preprocessing_gse15932_3.csv gene expression files with T2DM-PaC and healthy samples data.
* comorbidity_features_list.csv contains the list of selected 67 comorbidity feature genes.
* gnb_pac.sav, xgb_pac.sav trained model for PaC prediction.
* svm_t2d.sav,lr_t2d.sav trained model for T2DM prediction.
3. Replace “NULL” with your file name OR you can proceed with the sample files given. 
4. Genes should be given in rows and samples should be given in columns. 
5. Run “normalization.R” in R for normalization of preprocessed data.
* To normalize T2DM-PaC comorbidity
* Input: given preprocessed sample files or your preprocessed gene expression data in CSV format
* OUTPUT: normalized gene expression values for 67 gene comorbidity features.  
6. Run “T2DM-PaC_prediction_model.py” in Python for comorbidity prediction.
* To predict T2DM-PaC comorbidity
* Input: pre-processed and normalized gene expression data
* OUTPUT: Score file with 3 columns, for T2DM prediction, PaC prediction, and comorbidity prediction.  
* OUTPT: '1' indicates the presence and '0' indicates the absence of respective disease
